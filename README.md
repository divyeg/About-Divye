### Amazon.com: Data Scientist; Bellevue, WA; June 2021 - present
#### Project: Employee Safety Risk Evaluation and Decision Models (Driver Science); Tools: Reshift, SQL, Python, S3, SKLearn, Tree-based Classifiers
* Used logistic regression to calculate weights of different driving behaviors and suggested weights for safety scorecard for last mile drivers. Summarized the experience change using volatility and descriptive statistics to recommend improvements in the overall safety experience.
* Used tree based classification algorithms to build internal safety risk evaluation model using telematics data, weather data and other safety related data, designed decision mechanisms around personalized coaching aimed at reducing Accidents per Million Miles and influencing driving behavior change among last mile drivers.

#### Project: Labor Attendance Forecast (Sort Centers); Tools: Redshift, ETL, SQL, Python, Catboost Classifier, SKLearn, S3
* Multivariate time series forecasting approach using regression-based model to forecast point estimates for labor attendance - 28 days into the future. Input feature set includes data distribution-based features, time related features, holiday features and categorical features. Average WMAPE = 7, average improvement over base model ~ 159bps (544 bps max)

### Amazon.com: Business Intelligence Engineer; Seattle, WA; Jan 2020 - May 2021
#### Project: Evaluate CSA performance score for delivery success rate (DSR) and build variance bridging tool; Tools: Redshift, ETL, SQL, Tableau, Python, XGBoost
* Developed machine learning model using XGBoost to predict probability for successful DSR on package contact to learn scenarios where SDS agent is expected to perform good based on historical CSA and driver performance
* Demonstrated better coaching tool based on probability of success instead of actual metric to highlight low performing agents
* InnovatedperformancevsmixcontributionindextobridgeDSRvariancebetweenanytwoweeks across various attributes like marketplace, contact position, shipment path (hard coded program specific heuristics), shipment scan prior contact
#### Project: Sic code translation and intent classification; Tools: Redshift, ETL, AWS Translate, AWS Comprehend, Cloud Desktop, S3, EC2, Python, SQL
* Translated non - English sic codes to English using AWS Translate and Comprehend by detecting language
* Classified the translated English sic codes into major categories using keyword search by removing syntactical error using lemmatization and stemming

### Deloitte Consulting LLP: Data Scientist; McLean, VA; Aug 2019 - Dec 2020
#### Industry: Healthcare and Pharmaceutical; Project: Patient Segmentation and Outreach Prioritization; Tools PySpark, Python, Databricks, Azure, Spectral Clustering
